**Project Statement**

An interactive app which allows a group of friends to simplify the process of deciding where to eat for outings. 

An event creator needs to specify the location and budget of the event and assign it to a group. Google Places API is used to obtain details of restaurant’s satisfying the user’s criteria. Firebase Realtime Database then stores this information alongside other event and group details. 

Next, users indicate their preferences by swiping eitehr left or right on presented options. Once all the users have finished swiping or the deadline for selection has passed, the app finds a match based on the votes and notifies them about the restaurant for their event.
